# thyroid_prediction_using_classification
This project is used to determine hypothyroid using various data mining techniques and classification algorithms. 
In this I have typically used KNN, Naive bayes and random forest classification algorithm. 

I have also considered feature selection that is in KNN algorithm, model is trained with all parameters.
While in Naive bayes and Random forest I have used only 3 key parameters.

The conclusion of the project is that Naive bayer and Random forest algorithm gives similar accuracy using 3 parameters than KNN which was trained using all parameters.
